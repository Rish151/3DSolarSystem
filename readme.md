## 1. Introduction

The Solar System 3D Visualization project is an interactive web-based application that allows users to explore the Solar System in a three-dimensional environment. Developed using the Three.js library, it brings the celestial dance of planets to life with realistic motion and interactivity. Users can witness both orbital rotation and self-rotation of planets, along with additional features for a more educational and entertaining experience.

## 2. Project Overview

The project consists of an HTML file that sets up the web page, loads required libraries, and defines the basic structure. The main JavaScript file, `solarSystem.js`, contains the code that creates the 3D scene, loads textures for planets and space, and handles animation, interactivity, and UI controls.

## 3. Features

* Realistic 3D visualization of the Solar System.
* Interactive controls to explore the planets and their orbits.
* Labels or tooltips on hover that display the name of each planet.
* A **Pause/Resume** button to control the animation flow.
* **Toggle control** buttons to customize your experience.

### Speed Control

You can adjust the animation speed to your preference. The `speed` slider in the GUI allows you to control the rate at which the planets rotate and move around the Sun. Slide it to the right to speed up the animation and to the left to slow it down.

### Show/Hide Planet Paths

The application provides an option to show or hide the orbital paths of the planets around the Sun. Toggle the "Show path" option in the GUI to visualize or hide these trajectories.

### Realistic Lighting

The "Real view" option in the GUI replicates space-like lighting. Planets facing away from the Sun are not illuminated and appear darker, giving a more accurate depiction of planetary lighting conditions.

### Labels on Hover

Hovering over any planet displays a tooltip or label showing its name, making the application informative and beginner-friendly.

### Pause/Resume Animation

You can pause or resume the entire solar system's motion using a dedicated **Pause/Resume** button, useful for closely inspecting the system or demonstrating specific planets.

### Toggle Control Buttons

Multiple toggle options are available through the user interface (GUI) to control features like:
* Show Path – Display or hide planetary orbits.
* Real View – Enable realistic lighting and shading effects.
* Planet Visibility – Optionally hide or display specific planets for focused exploration.
These toggle buttons make the experience customizable and enhance usability for different learning or demo scenarios.
